## Due to extended sickness, I crunched assignment 1 and 2 together starting Monday. Sucks.

# $1 Gesture Recognizer
- The Gesture Recognizer itself is located in recognizer.py
- The GUI is located in recognizer_interface.py
- Start the GUI and start drawing! Feedback will be displayed in the cmd line.

# Mid-Air Gestures with $1 Recognizer
- Located at pointing_input.py
- Start the program, it may take a while to open.
- You have the option to input with the mouse just like in assignment 1.
- Alternatively, you may press R to toggle having the mouse be mapped to your index finger tip.
- Hold the left mouse button to begin recording, then move your finger to draw. Release the left mouse button to finish.
- Upon completion, a xml file will be created. You may change the name of the file at the top of pointing_input.py
