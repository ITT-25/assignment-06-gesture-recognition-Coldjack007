## Richard Mairinger (7.5/20P)

### Implementing the $1 Gesture Recognizer (3/4P)
* $1 gesture recognizer works and is efficiently implemented
    * yep (2P)
* Five gestures can be distinguished
    * yep (1P)
* Gesture entry user interface
    * points are not drawn in realtime, no connection between them, and prediction only in the command line (0P)


### Mid-Air Gestures with $1 Recognizer (4.5/6P)
* Pose detection works reliably and with low latency
    * yep (1P)
* Mapping of landmarks to a pointer position works
    * yep (2P)
* Application controls the mouse pointer
    * yep (1P)
* Mid-air gesture interaction is integrated into $1 recognizer
    * yep (1P)
* Recording works and recorded ata is stored appropriately
    * no timestamp (-0.5P)
* had to continously use the mouse while doing the gesture (-0.5P)
* had to do the gestures mirrored (-0.5P)
